# orchestra
Orchestra intends to be a scalable, secure and reliable cloud orchestration framework. It uses zookeeper to coordinate operations in a distributed cloud environment. The communication between orchestra hosts, including the zookeeper server, are all secured by SSL. The ro directory includes  openstack icehouse and mitaka version. I've planned to add hadoop, spark and ceph installation scripts in the future. Right now, orchestra only supports ubuntu, centos will be supported in the future.
